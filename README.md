A minimal MVP architecture helper for android applications. This is inspired by a lot of awesome open source libraries out there and I'm tired of carrying/copying this around all of my projects.

## installation

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'in.vishrayne:mvp-architecture:0.1.0'
}
```

--work in progress--
I'll be updating this very soon, till then see app module for usage.
